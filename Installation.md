Optionally you can install sessionrc- set of interface preferences including predefined docks, layout and other minor changes.

To do that, download **'sessionrc para GPS 2.0'**, unzip and copy files to your Gimp preferences directory as described above.



Please note, that while GPS won't overwrite default set of brushes and presets, it will add it's content into specific folders, however, sessionrc files WILL overwrite existing default files. If you are not sure whether you will find them useful, please backup sessionrc files before installing new ones to easily revert changes.
