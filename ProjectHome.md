## What is GPS? ##

---


GPS is a **collection of brushes and accompanying tool presets**. Tool presets are a simply saved tool options, highly useful feature of the GIMP.

The goal of GPS is to **provide an adequate working environment for graphic designers and artists** to begin to paint and feel comfortable with GIMP from their first use. Later the user will change these settings based on his own workflow preferences and understanding of GIMP.

_GPS is only a starting point for presets and brushes and is intended to highlight the expansive flexibility of GIMP.  **It is also intended as a way to learn from  and share with each other** within the GIMP community.  That is why GPS comes with the Creative Commons license._
