_Gimp Paint Studio_ is, as described on the front page "a collection of **brushes** and accompanying "tool presets" for the free open-source program [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org).

But it is also an attempt at something more. It is also an independent initiative to push for the increased awareness that Gimp is _not_ only useful for cropping photos, adjusting colour balances and make minor website graphics.

Gimp is also **an excellent tool for digital painters**, creating completely new works of art from scratch, a capacity that is not always fully realized by the default setup, untill now. Developers are working on more features for next releases.

The GPS's collected artistic media presets and brush collection is one step on the way towards making GIMP a more pleasant environment for digital artists.

So if you want to know more about GPS check it out the Wiki pages on the left side of the screen!


# ... But why stop there? #

These wiki pages try to combine the experiences and ideas of a group of artists which is _already_ actively and regularly using GIMP for digital painting.
The plan is to **come up with suggestions** and possibly develope a plan for what GIMP would need in order to better suit our particular needs.

_Who knows, maybe we can make the difference?_


Greets to all, i hope you enjoy your visit.
